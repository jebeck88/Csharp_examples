This is a simple example that:

1.  Demonstrates polymorphism using animals (Dog, Pig) that implement a common interface (IAnimal)
	
2.  Uses an abstract base class to capture common behavior of the subtypes (AbstractAnimal)
	
3.  Uses a repository implemented as a threadsafe singleton (AnimalShelter)
	
4.  Uses a factory and static, generic factory method (AnimalBreeder)
